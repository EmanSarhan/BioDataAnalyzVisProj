## 1. SeqManipulator_CHROME_Ext_app (Version x1.0):
It's a a biological sequence manipulator CHROME extension app project, build with JavaScript Manifest MV3.0.
Features available:
* manipulate all types of biological sequences (e.g., DNA, RNA, Protein sequences).
* process unlimited number of entries' seqence length [nucleotides or amino acids].
* accept any format type of sequence (e.g., FASTA format, ...etc).
* direct detect of the sequence type (DNA, RNA or Protein).
* all possible sequence conversions for the submited entries (e,g. complement, reverse, reverse complement, transcript RNA, translated Protein, ...etc.).
* predict some calculations of the sequence entries (e.g., sequence length, GC content %, melting tempeature, IP).
